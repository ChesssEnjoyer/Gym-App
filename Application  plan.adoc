== Data
Database:
Columns representing: ex name, muscle group, compound movement, difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced), gender(woman, male, none), 
favourite(0 or 1 based on favourite users exercises), overall rating(0-100)(determines which excercises are better than another)

== UX, UI:
Smooth Onboarding:
A simple questionnaire gathering essential details: Experience level, workout frequency goals, gender, age (to adjust intensity), goal(hipertrophy/ strength).
Optional: Allow users to "favorite" exercises or target specific muscle groups or excercise which user don't wants to do.
Intuitive Interface:
Clean, distraction-free design focusing on core functions.
Clear visual hierarchy for plan display and exercise information.
Workout Plan Display:
Each workout presented in an easily digestible format with:
Exercise name, sets, reps, and recommended rest times.

== AI-Driven Plan Generation:
Algorithm Logic:
Leverages collected user data (experience, gender, etc.) to adjust workout complexity.
The AI algorithm determines the ideal split routine (e.g. full-body, upper/lower, push/pull) based on the user's chosen training days and experience level
Incorporates a weighting system based on exercise importance, favorites and muscle group priorities.
Balances exercises to ensure full-body development and prevent overtraining.

== Run tests.

== Release app so people can use it.

== Possibly update app 
Add more functions (workout and weight tracking, nutrition, users opinions on exercises, challanges, users ratings).
