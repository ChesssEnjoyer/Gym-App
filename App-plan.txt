1. Data
Database:
Columns representing: ex name, muscle group, compound movement, difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced), gender(woman, male, none), 
favourite(0 or 1 based on favourite users exercises), overall rating(0-100)(determines which excercises are better than another)

2. UX, UI:
Smooth Onboarding:
A simple questionnaire gathering essential details: Experience level, workout frequency goals, gender, age (to adjust intensity), goal(hipertrophy/ strength).
Optional: Allow users to "favorite" exercises or target specific muscle groups or excercise which user don't wants to do.
Intuitive Interface:
Clean, distraction-free design focusing on core functions.
Clear visual hierarchy for plan display and exercise information.
Workout Plan Display:
Each workout presented in an easily digestible format with:
Exercise name linked to detailed instructions (text and video).
Sets, reps, and recommended rest times.

3. AI-Driven Plan Generation:
Algorithm Logic:
Leverages collected user data (experience, gender, etc.) to adjust workout complexity.
Gender Nuances: While core training principles are the same, the algorithm can subtly adjust exercises and variations based on common gender-specific preferences and muscle-building differences.
The AI algorithm determines the ideal split routine (e.g. full-body, upper/lower, push/pull) based on the user's chosen training days and experience level
Incorporates a weighting system based on exercise importance, favorites and muscle group priorities.
Balances exercises to ensure full-body development and prevent overtraining.

4. Emphasizing Exercise Importance:
Dynamic Descriptions: Describe not just the exercise, but why it's included based on the user's goals and fitness level.

5. Run tests.

6. Release app so people can use it.

7. Possibly update app adding more functions (workout and weight tracking, nutrition, users opinions on exercises, challanges, users ratings).
